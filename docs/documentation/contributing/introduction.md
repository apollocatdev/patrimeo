# Contributing

We welcome contributions. In this section, you will find everything needed to develop new services to integrate with an external system. 

New integrations can be of three types:

- **Cotations**, to update the price of a particular asset.
- **Transfers**, to update assets quantity and store new transfers automatically,
- **Importers**, to import data.
